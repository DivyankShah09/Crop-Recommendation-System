<h1>Crop Recommendation System</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">A ML and DL based website that recommends the optimum crop to grow based on the soil composition and atmospheric conditions.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<ul>
    <li>One of the key elements influencing a nation's economic development is the agriculture sector.</li>
    <li>In nations like India, the majority of the population relies on agriculture for a living.</li>
    <li>New technologies like machine learning and deep learning are being used in agriculture as it gets increasingly automated.</li>
    <li>Farmers will be able to increase productivity and maximise their harvest with the help of this techniques.</li>
    <li>One of the most crucial elements of precision and automated agriculture is crop suggestion. Numerous variables are taken into account while recommending crops.</li>
    <li>Farmers often don't know which crops to grow.</li>
    <li>In this project, we aim to build such a website in which farmers will give
        input on the soil composition of the field and the climatic condition of the area. Based on several parameters, the website will suggest which crop will be most suitable according to the given inputs by the farmer with the help of artificial neural network.</li>
</ul>
